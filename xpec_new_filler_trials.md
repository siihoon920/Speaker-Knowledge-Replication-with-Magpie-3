We also have **48 filler trials**, which are designed to resemble the general structure of the main trials, but differ from them in the **critical conditions for camouflage**. (The structure of the main trials is provided on the left of the arrow, and the general structure used in the filler trials on the right.)

- **Context**: sets context of speaker knowledge → sets context of situation
- **Trigger**:  
  - **Type ambiguous** (scalar trigger in main trials): introduces ambiguity with possibilities of two implicatures → introduces a choice between two similarly plausible interpretations  
  - **Type unambiguous** (focused trigger in main trials): introduces a source of implication → introduces a more certain choice between two interpretations with biased plausibility  
- **Continuation**:  
  - **Type ambiguous**: reinforces or rejects implicature → confirms one of the possible interpretations and rejects the other  
  - **Type unambiguous**: confirms implication → reinforces the biased interpretation  

We have 12 trials of 4 types of filler trials, each of which differs from the main trials in its own way. In types that involve **type unambiguous**, the majority was chosen to be **type unambiguous** in order to maximize naturalness and balance out the ratio between types when combined with the main trials. This is intended to help the participant **spread their attention evenly** across all 3 sentences.

## **Filler Type 1–3: Difference in Trigger (36 trials)**

Of the 4 types, the following 3 create variation by introducing a **different source of ambiguity** in the **trigger sentence**.

---

### **1. Pronoun Resolution – Equal Accessibility (12 trials)**

inspired by Greene et al. 1992, further trials hand & AI generated 

- **Context**: `Mary and John were doing the dishes after dinner.`  
- **Trigger**: `One of them was washing while the other dried.`  
- **Continuation**: `Mary accidentally scratched John with a knife and then she dropped it on the counter.`  

#### **Type ambiguous (12 trials)**

- **Trigger**: introduces equal mental accessibility to two names (`Mary` & `John`) using the phrase `one of them... the other...`  
- **Continuation**: confirms the reference to one of the names with a pronoun `she`

### **2. Polysemy Resolution – Semantically Related Nouns (12 trials)**

modified from Foraker & Murphy 2012, context sentence further padded 

#### **Type unambiguous (9 trials)**

- **Context**: `The CEO updated the design team on their latest collection.`  
- **Trigger**: `The fashion designers discussed the cotton.`  
- **Continuation**: `The fabric was not what they had been hoping for.`

- **Trigger**: disambiguates the polysemous noun `cotton` (fabric vs. plant), favoring *fabric* due to the semantically related profession `fashion designers`  
- **Continuation**: confirms the fabric interpretation

#### **Type ambiguous (3 trials)**

- **Context**: `The instructor showed us the final step in the practical session.`  
- **Trigger**: `She meticulously tested the filling.`  
- **Continuation**: `The metal was smooth and even on the teeth.`

- **Trigger**: the use of `filling` without bias toward a specific interpretation (culinary vs. dental) maintains ambiguity  
- **Continuation**: confirms one interpretation — that `the filling` refers to a dental procedure

---

### **3. Pronoun Resolution – Semantically Related Nouns (12 trials)**

inspired by Lago et al. 2017, further trials hand & AI generated 

#### **Type unambiguous (9 trials)**

- **Context**: `The maintenance men told the singer about a problem.`  
- **Trigger**: `They had broken his piano and would have to repair that first.`  
- **Continuation**: `The singer agreed but asked for a replacement keyboard until the repair is finished.`

- **Trigger**: introduces unambiguous reference of the possessive pronoun `his` to `the singer`, as supported by the semantically related noun `piano`  
- **Continuation**: confirms the more plausible interpretation, referencing `the singer`

#### **Type ambiguous (3 trials)**

- **Context**: `The researcher and the interns walked into the break room.`  
- **Trigger**: `He noticed their coffee cups were still on the table.`  
- **Continuation**: `The researcher asked the interns to clean up next time.`

- **Trigger**: introduces ambiguous reference of the possessive pronoun `their` to either `the researcher` or `the interns`, using a semantically neutral noun `coffee cups`  
- **Continuation**: confirms one interpretation — that the coffee cups belonged to the `interns`

---

## **Filler Type 4: Difference in Continuation (12 trials)**

AI & hand generated

### **4. Scalar**
inspired by Lago et al. 2017, further trials hand & AI generated 


This final type uses the **same scalar trigger** as in the main trials but differs in that the **continuation sentence confirms neither implicature**.

- **Context**: `After the forest fire, I conducted an official survey of the damage.`  
- **Trigger**: `Many of the large trees burned down.`  
- **Continuation**: `Nevertheless, my data suggested the ecosystem would bounce back.`  

- **Trigger**: uses scalar term `many`, which could imply *not all*  
- **Continuation**: neutral — does not resolve either possible implicature
